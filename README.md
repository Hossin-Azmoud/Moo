# An interactive Shell made using python.
## Quick start
- In order for this shell to work, download `Python version 3.9`.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Moody0101-X/Moo
    $ python venv venv && cd venv\Scripts && activate
    $ cd ../../src && main.py
```

## Tools

- This section is still under developement, please wait untill I optimize and rewrite the code. it is totally garbage at the moment.
- You can perform basic os commands, like rmdir, mkdir, cd, ls/dir..


## To Do
    - [] rewrite the garbage code...
    - [*] restructure the project...
